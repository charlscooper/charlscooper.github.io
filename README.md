## Background

Software development started for me around twelve years old, creating simple batch files to find solutions to simple problems.
For example to execute shutdown commands allowing me to download movies and games over night, then have the pc shut down before my parents would awaken and scold me for running the computer throughout the night.

My early interest in computers has driven me to pursue a career in software development, and I have since gained extensive insight and experience in this field. Gaining a great deal of knowledge in the world of software systems, how they work and more importantly how to engineer them to overcome 'real world' problems of any size.

## Professional Summary

As I continue down the road of software development and design, I believe it to be imperative to create fast performant and well designed testable code that follows modern coding standards.

I ensure this through the practice and execution of '_clean code_', as a great role model of mine Robert Martin puts it:

> ‚ÄúClean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.‚Äù

Care I do, after all creating good software can alleviate problems faced by many people and businesses.

I have a wide array of knowledge in different areas of code, of course my experience in each varies. However, I've always found it both fun and easy to pickup new syntax / softwares or refine my knowledge, so I have full confidence in myself to achieve results in any areas required for given problems. <br> Below I've listed some of my main areas for clarification:

- Mobile Development (Android / IOS development, React Native)
- Programming languages (Java, C#)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React)
- Project management software (JIRA)
- Database management (SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS)
- Graphic design (Adobe Photoshop, Figma)
- Source control (Git, github/bitbucket)
- Software Methodologies (Agile, Scrum, TDD, BDD)
