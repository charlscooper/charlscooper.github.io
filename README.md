## Background

Software development started for me around twelve years old, creating simple batch files to find solutions to simple problems.
For example to execute shutdown commands allowing me to download movies and games over night, then have the pc shut down before my parents would awaken and scold me for running the computer throughout the night.

My early interest in computers has driven me to pursue a career in software development, and I have since gained extensive knowledge and experience in this field. Gaining a great deal of knowledge in the world of software systems, how they work and more importantly how to engineer them to overcome real world problems of any size.

## Professional Summary

As I continue down the road of software development and design, I believe it to be imperative to create fast performant and well designed testable code that follows modern coding standards.

I ensure this through the practice and execution of '_clean code_', as a great role model of mine Robert Martin puts it:

> ‚ÄúClean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.‚Äù

And care I do, after all creating good software can alleviate problems many people and businesses face.

I have a wide array of knowledge in different areas of code, of course my experience in each varies, however I've always found it both fun and easy to pickup new syntax / softwares or refine my knowledge so there's full confidence in myself to achieve results in any areas required for given problems. Either way I will list here some of main areas for clarification:

- Mobile Development (Android / IOS development, React Native)
- Programming languages (Java, C#)
- Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Typescript, React)
- Project management software (JIRA)
- Database management (SQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS)
- Graphic design (Adobe Photoshop, Figma)
- Source control (Git, github/bitbucket)
- Software Methodologies (Agile)

## Work Experience

#### Software Engineer

(_Current Employment_)

TotalMobile | 2020-2023

Responsibilities here involved working as a dedicated developer resource for Evri (_previously known as Hermes_).

I was required to communicate directly with the client and create designs and solutions to multiple mobile workforce applications that spanned from Depot parcel management to delivery systems.

This was a challenging time as Covid hit and the increased demand of parcel deliveries sky rocketed, alas we as a team handled that and proved our resilience and fortitude as work from home became mandatory and the increase in workload was stressful to say the least.

Whilst Here I was looking to further my knowledge in React, and was able to take the lead on developing some React powered internal development tools.
This opened a new opportunity for React development and moved to a team where I would work on apps for management systems for a multitude of well respected clients throughout the UK and Ireland.

#### Software Engineer

Cognito IQ | 2019-2020

Responsibilities here included managing workloads for multiple highly respected clients from Baxi boilers, Integral, Transport for London etc.

I would create designs and develop and build state managed workforce applications for mobile, used throughout the UK to help our workers complete their workdays.

This could include scanning, signatures, forms, map route calculations and much more.

The key softwares here mainly focused on the use of javascript.

#### Software Consultant

Capita | 2018-2019

Responsibilities here consisted of venturing to clients (all the main colleges throughout the UK) discussing requirements and consulting them on decisions to be made for softwares they wished to create.

these could range in functionality from management systems to booking systems etc.

Here I made use of the .NET framework alongside C# to create MVC modeled websites to serve on the front-end, creation of API's to communicate with the back-end systems where I would have to manage user role systems.

## Achievements/Projects

A personal achievement to show my dedication and discipline is that after 8 hard years I achieved a black belt in Ju-Jit-Su.

As well as this growing up I have played football for many teams, almost all of those teams I became the Captain, showing my leadership skills.

In terms of software I tend to have active side projects where I create things from games in powerful game engines such as unity to creating websites powered by the use of AI.

Alongside these, I also work with clients that I procure myself to deliver software solutions on a freelance level, for example I have developed a fully functional property website for the use of buying/selling houses on. You can see this work [here](https://www.thepropertyclick.com/).
