## Background

My journey into software development began at the age of twelve, when I started crafting simple batch files to solve everyday challenges. One notable example was creating shutdown commands, enabling me to download files overnight while ensuring the computer powered down before my parents awoke.

This early experimentation led me to seek guidance from my cousin, a seasoned software engineer, who introduced me to the fascinating world of communicating with computers. From that moment, my curiosity was ignited, setting me on a path towards a career in software development.

Over the years, my dedication and hard work have afforded me a wealth of experience and deep insights into this dynamic field. I've honed my skills in understanding intricate software systems and, more importantly, in engineering solutions to tackle 'real world' challenges, ranging from the substantial to the minute.

I go further to ensure this through the practice and execution of '_clean code_', as a great role model of mine Robert Martin puts it:

> “Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.”

Care I do, after all creating good software can alleviate problems faced by many people and businesses.

I have a wide array of knowledge in different areas of code, of course my experience in each varies. However, fortunately I've always found the challenge of new syntax / softwares or refining my intellect fun and allows me to showcase my ability to technically analyse and problem-solve.
